# Delta-Algorithm-For-Lottery-Sim

Basic Description: This program uses the "Delta Algorithim" to simulate a lottery.
The user inputs 6 numbers as instructed and the program creates 6 lottery
numbers which are then compared to winning numbers. These winning numbers are
randomly generated each time and the game is played 1 million times. The numbers of
every 10000th generated set of numbers is displayed to the screen. This program is intended
to be run from the command line.

This program is in no way efficient or perfect in any sense. This program is intended for those
beginning to learn C and want to see basic C concepts demonstrated. The code is commented for better
readability.

The program uses the following libraries:

  *stdio.h
  *stdlib.h
  *time.h

The program was compiled using gcc version 7.4.0 on Ubuntu 18.04.1. I provided a exectuable
in this repository but feel free to make your own. This program is free for anyone to take, modify,
and use for any reason. Feel free to take this file and edit it to make it a better example for
those beginning in C. I wrote this as a class project so I was still learning C at the time. I tried
to make comments that clearly explain what each part of the program is doing. Feel free to change those
as well!
